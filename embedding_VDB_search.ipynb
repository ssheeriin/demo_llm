    "# Embeddings, Vector Databases, and Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting text into embedding vectors is the first step to any text processing pipeline. As the amount of text gets larger, there is often a need to save these embedding vectors into a dedicated vector index or library, so that developers won't have to recompute the embeddings and the retrieval process is faster. We can then search for documents based on our intended query and pass these relevant documents into a language model (LM) as additional context. We also refer to this context as supplying the LM with \"state\" or \"memory\". The LM then generates a response based on the additional context it receives! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement the full workflow of text vectorization, vector search, and question answering workflow. While we use [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/) (vector library) and [ChromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/) (vector database), and a Hugging Face model, know that you can easily swap these tools out for your preferred tools or models!\n",

    "Vector libraries are often sufficient for small, static data. Since it's not a full-fledged database solution, it doesn't have the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) support. Once the index has been built, if there are more vectors that need to be added/removed/edited, the index has to be rebuilt from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, vector libraries are easy, lightweight, and fast to use. Examples of vector libraries are [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/), [ScaNN](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann), [ANNOY](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), and [HNSM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320).\n",
    "\n",
    "FAISS has several ways for similarity search: L2 (Euclidean distance), cosine similarity. You can read more about their implementation on their [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Getting-started#searching) page or [blog post](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/). They also published their own [best practice guide here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Guidelines-to-choose-an-index).\n",
